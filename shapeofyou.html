			<h1>Shape of You</h1>
			<p>
			The club isn't the best place to find a lover<br>
			So the bar is where I go (mmmm)<br>
			Me and my friends at the table doing shots<br>
			Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)<br>
			And you come over and start up a conversation with just me<br>
			And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)<br>
			Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox<br>
			And then we start to dance<br>
			And now I'm singing like<br>
			<br>
			Girl, you know I want your love<br>
			Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
			Come on now, follow my lead<br>
			I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
			Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
			Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
			Come on now, follow my lead<br>
			Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)<br>
			<br>
			I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
			We push and pull like a magnet do<br>
			Although my heart is falling too<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Last night you were in my room<br>
			And now my bedsheets smell like you<br>
			Every day discovering something brand new<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			<br>
			Oh I oh I oh I oh I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Oh I oh I oh I oh I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Oh I oh I oh I oh I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Every day discovering something brand new<br>
			I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
			<br>
			One week in we let the story begin<br>
			We're going out on our first date (mmmm)<br>
			You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat<br>
			Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)<br>
			We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour<br>
			And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)<br>
			And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat<br>
			Tell the driver make the radio play<br>
			And I'm singing like<br>
			<br>
			Girl, you know I want your love<br>
			Your love was handmade for somebody like me<br>
			Come on now, follow my lead<br>
			I may be crazy, don't mind me<br>
			Say, boy, let's not talk too much<br>
			Grab on my waist and put that body on me<br>
			Come on now, follow my lead<br>
			Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)<br>

			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Oh I oh I oh I oh I<br>
			I'm in love with your body<br>
			Every day discovering something brand new<br>
			I'm in love with the shape of you<br>
			<br>
			Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
			Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
			Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
			Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
			Come on, be my baby, come on<br>
