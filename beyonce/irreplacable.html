			<h1>Irreplacable</h1>
			<p>
			To the left, to the left<br>
			To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)<br>
			To the left, to the left<br>
			<br>
			Everything you own in the box to the left<br>
			In the closet that's my stuff<br>
			Yes, if I bought it, please don't touch<br>
			And keep talking that mess that's fine<br>
			But could you walk and talk at the same time<br>
			And, it's my name that's on that jag<br>
			So come move your bags, let me call you a cab<br>
			<br>
			Standing in the front yard<br>
			Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool<br>
			Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you<br>
			You got me twisted<br>
			<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I could have another you in a minute<br>
			Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I can have another you by tomorrow<br>
			So don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br>
			You're irreplaceable<br>
			<br>
			So go ahead and get gone<br>
			Call up that chick and see if she's home<br>
			Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know<br>
			What did you think I was putting you out for<br>
			Because you was untrue<br>
			Rollin' her around in the car that I bought you<br>
			Baby drop them keys<br>
			Hurry up before your taxi leaves<br>
			<br>
			Standing in the front yard<br>
			Tellin' me, how I'm such a fool<br>
			Talkin' bout, I'll never ever find a man like you<br>
			You got me twisted<br>
			<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I could have another you in a minute<br>
			Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I can have another you by tomorrow<br>
			So don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br>
			You're irreplaceable<br>
			<br>
			So since I'm not your everything<br>
			How about I'll be nothing<br>
			Nothing at all to you<br>
			Baby I won't shed a tear for you<br>
			I won't lose a wink of sleep<br>
			'Cause the truth of the matter is<br>
			Replacing you is so easy<br>
			<br>
			To the left, to the left<br>
			To the left, to the left (mmmmmm)<br>
			To the left, to the left<br>
			Everything you own in the box to the left<br>
			To the left, to the left<br>
			Don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br>
			You're irreplaceable<br>
			<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I could have another you in a minute<br>
			Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I can have another you by tomorrow<br>
			So don't you ever for a second get to thinking (baby)<br>
			You must not know about me, you must not know about me<br>
			I could have another you in a minute<br>
			Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute<br>
			You can pack all your bags<br>
			We're finished<br>
			'Cause you made your bed<br>
			Now lay in it<br>
			I can have another you by tomorrow<br>
			Don't you ever for a second get to thinking<br>
			You're irreplaceable
