			<h1>Yes</h1>
			<p>
			I said yes to your number<br>
			And yes to you dating me<br>
			Yes we can be together<br>
			But you gotta wait for me<br>
			The first time i said no<br>
			Its like I never said yes<br>
			<br>
			I said yes we can be together<br>
			Yes you can stay with me<br>
			But when I say no not tonight<br>
			You actin so ungratefully<br>
			The first time I said no<br>
			Its like I never said yes<br>
			<br>
			You was on the wall<br>
			I was with my crew<br>
			You was watching me baby<br>
			I was watching you<br>
			Slowly you walked over <br>
			I maintained my cool<br>
			You said hello to me<br>
			I said hello to you<br>
			<br>
			You ask me where I'm from<br>
			I asked you what you do<br>
			You some how intrigued me<br>
			I thought you were so cool<br>
			Somewhere between hi and goodbye<br>
			I felt so comfortable<br>
			I felt like we could talk all night<br>
			So i gave my number to you<br>
			<br>
			I said yes to your number<br>
			And yes to you dating me<br>
			Yes we can be together<br>
			But you gotta wait for me<br>
			The first time I said no<br>
			Its like I never said yes<br>
			<br>
			I said yes we can be together <br>
			Yes you can stay with me<br>
			But when I say no not tonight<br>
			You actin so ungratefully <br>
			The first time I said no<br>
			Its like I never said yes<br>
			<br>
			Certainly you can call me baby<br>
			I love to here from you<br>
			Yes of course you can come and see me boy<br>
			I wanna get to know you more<br>
			Sure I'm feeling you<br>
			No baby, not yet<br>
			We can't take that next step<br>
			Why you getting so upset, boy you<br>
			Act as though I never told you yes before<br>
			You are so ungrateful<br>
			ummm ummm ummm<br>
			<br>
			You was at my house <br>
			I was sitting on the couch<br>
			You was really buggin<br>
			So I told you to get out<br>
			I had been misjudging you<br>
			You had a lotta nerve, you<br>
			Too damn old to be so immature<br>
			I hope you learn<br>
			You said I move to slow<br>
			I showed you to the door<br>
			You said you call me later<br>
			I said don't call no more<br>
			Its cool if you can't wait for me<br>
			I'm glad you let me know<br>
			Cuz you showed me your true face baby<br>
			The first time I said no<br>
			<br>
