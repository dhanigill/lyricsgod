               <h2> About Site</h2>
                   <p>This website is all about Lyrics of songs that are sung by some of famous singers. The songs have been selected by asking my friends about their favourite songs and singers. These singer also have various other songs but to that would make the content really vast and difficult for a beginner like me.</p>
                   <p>I decided to make a project on Lyrics Website because i have a close connection with music and lyrics. I also have an interest in writing songs and poems in my mother tongue<i> i.e.</i><strong>"Punjabi"</strong>.</p>
                   <p>I have done a lot of hardwork to make this project. Finally I would like to Thank each and everyone who helped me in this project especially the professor.</p><br>
