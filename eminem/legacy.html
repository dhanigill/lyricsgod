			<h1>Legacy</h1>
			<p>
			Tell me where to go, tell me what to do<br>
			I'll be right there for you<br>
			Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true<br>
			I'll say it all for you<br>
			<br>

			I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling<br>
			Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?<br>
			What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?<br>
			'Cause I don't belong in this world<br>
			That's why I'm scoffing at authority, defiant often<br>
			Flying off at the handle at my mom, no dad<br>
			So I am non-compliant at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward<br>
			And I don't need no goddamn psychologist<br>
			Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems<br>
			Thinking he can try and solve them<br>
			I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk<br>
			And in the front drive talking to myself<br>
			Either that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet<br>
			Trying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing<br>
			I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking<br>
			Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker<br>
			'Cause he said that I eyeballed him<br>
			<br>
			And if you fall, I'll get you there<br>
			I'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought<br>
			Inside your world<br>
			Please have faith in my words<br>
			<br>
			'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy, eh<br>
			There's no guarantee,<br>
			It's not up to me,<br>
			We can only see<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy<br>
			Legacy, legacy<br>
			<br>

			I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling<br>
			Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?<br>
			'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling<br>
			'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit<br>
			Bothers me but not my father, he said Sayonara then split<br>
			But I don't give a shit I'm fine long as<br>
			There's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me<br>
			Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking<br>
			I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment<br>
			Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I<br>
			Find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it<br>
			Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit<br>
			But if this is all there is for me life offers<br>
			Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense<br>
			But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience<br>
			What about them rhymes I've been jottin'<br>
			They're kinda giving me confidence<br>
			Instead of tryna escape through my comics,<br>
			Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx<br>
			To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that<br>
			Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him<br>
			Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch<br>
			Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that<br>
			I could be iconic, and my conquest<br>
			Is word to Phife Dawg from a tribe called Quest<br>
			<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy, eh<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy, eh<br>
			There's no guarantee,<br>
			It's not up to me,<br>
			We can only see<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy<br>
			Legacy, legacy<br>
			<br>

			I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling<br>
			Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome<br>
			'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work<br>
			Words like this and connect lines like crosswords<br>
			And use my enemy's words as strength<br>
			To try and draw from, and get inspired off em<br>
			'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit<br>
			By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit<br>
			Now you shut up bitch, I am talking<br>
			Thought I was full of horseshit and now<br>
			You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking<br>
			Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins<br>
			Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense<br>
			So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins<br>
			It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins<br>
			'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers<br>
			You gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical<br>
			With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus<br>
			You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can<br>
			Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass<br>
			In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage<br>
			The most high exalting and I ain't halting<br>
			Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes<br>
			The best part about me is I am not you<br>
			I'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my<br>
			<br>
			Legacy, legacy, eh<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy, eh<br>
			There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see<br>
			This is my legacy, legacy<br>
			Legacy, legacy</p>
