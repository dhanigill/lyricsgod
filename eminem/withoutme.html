			<h1>Without Me</h1>
			<p>
			Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside<br>
			Two trailer-park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside<br>
			<br>
			Guess who's back, back again<br>
			Shady's back, tell a friend<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			Guess who's back<br>
			<br>
			I've created a monster<br>
			'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more<br>
			They want Shady I'm chopped liver<br>
			Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya<br>
			A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor<br>
			Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart<br>
			Quicker than a shock<br>
			When I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor<br>
			When I'm not cooperating<br>
			When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!)<br>
			<br>
			You waited this long now stop debating<br>
			'Cause I'm back I'm on the rag and ovulating<br>
			I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney<br>
			But your husband's heart problem's complicating<br>
			<br>
			So the FCC won't let me be<br>
			Or let me be me so let me see<br>
			They try to shut me down on MTV<br>
			But it feels so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			So come on dip, bum on your lips fuck that<br>
			Cum on your lips and some on your tits and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy<br>
			I just settled all my lawsuits<br>
			Fuck you, Debbie!<br>
			<br>
			Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br>
			'Cause we need a little controversy<br>
			'Cause it feels so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br>
			'Cause we need a little controversy<br>
			'Cause it feels so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			Little hellions kids feeling rebellious<br>
			Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis<br>
			They start feeling like prisoners, helpless<br>
			'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells &quot;bitch&quot;<br>
			<br>
			A visionary, vision is scary<br>
			Could start a revolution<br>
			Polluting the air waves a rebel<br>
			So just let me revel and bask<br>
			In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass<br>
			And it's a disaster<br>
			Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my ass<br>
			You ask for me?<br>
			<br>
			Well I'm back<br>
			Fix your bent antennae<br>
			Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in<br>
			And up under your skin like a splinter<br>
			The center of attention back for the winter<br>
			<br>
			I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling<br>
			Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting<br>
			Testing attention please<br>
			Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me<br>
			Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free<br>
			A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?<br>
			<br>
			Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br>
			'Cause we need a little controversy<br>
			'Cause it feels so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br>
			'Cause we need a little controversy<br>
			'Cause it feels so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			A tisk-it a task-it<br>
			I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit, that shit<br>
			Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked<br>
			Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards<br>
			<br>
			And Moby<br>
			You can get stomped by Obie<br>
			You 36 year old bald-headed fag blow me<br>
			You don't know me<br>
			You're too old<br>
			Let go<br>
			It's over, nobody listens to techno<br>
			<br>
			Now let's go, just give me the signal<br>
			I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults<br>
			I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil<br>
			Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol<br>
			<br>
			But sometimes the shit just seems<br>
			Everybody only wants to discuss me<br>
			So this must mean I'm disgusting<br>
			But it's just me I'm just obscene<br>
			<br>
			No, I'm not the first king of controversy<br>
			I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley<br>
			To do black music so selfishly<br>
			And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)<br>
			<br>
			There's a concept that works<br>
			20 million other white rappers emerge<br>
			But no matter how many fish in the sea<br>
			It'd be so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			Now this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br>
			'Cause we need a little controversy<br>
			'Cause it feels so empty without me<br>
			<br>
			I said this looks like a job for me so everybody just follow me<br>
			'Cause we need a little controversy<br>
			'Cause it feels so empty without me<br></p>
