			<h1>Untouchable</h1>
			<p>
			Hands up, officer don't shoot<br>
			Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot<br>
			We may never understand each other, it's no use<br>
			We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through<br>
			<br>
			Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you<br>
			Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you<br>
			Pull up on the side of you<br>
			Window rolled down, 'profile'<br>
			Then we wonder why we see this side of you<br>
			Probably comin' from the dope house<br>
			We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out<br>
			We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum<br>
			On you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you<br>
			And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true<br>
			Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it<br>
			In your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you<br>
			Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?<br>
			I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'<br>
			No matter how many lives you ruin<br>
			It's for the red, white and blue<br>
			Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two<br>
			No one's ever indicted you<br>
			Why? 'Cause you're a...<br>
			<br>

			White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar<br>
			(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)<br>
			White boy, white boy, in your cop car<br>
			(But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve)<br>
			White boy, white boy, you're untouchable<br>
			(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)<br>
			Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a (big rockstar)<br>
			<br>

			Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and<br>
			We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man<br>
			Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that<br>
			Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?<br>
			Why you kicking that soda can?<br>
			Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and<br>
			Throw your ass in the van cuffed<br>
			You don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are<br>
			Our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands<br>
			And put our minds more at ease<br>
			Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy<br>
			We're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine<br>
			Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities<br>
			That's what we call 'em pigsties for<br>
			They're like eyesores to police<br>
			Talk to you like just a piece of trash<br>
			Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me<br>
			As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions<br>
			As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in<br>
			To the sixties, having black skin is risky<br>
			'Cause this keeps happening<br>
			Throughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit<br>
			And I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...<br>
			<br>

			White boy, white boy, you're a rockstar<br>
			(My momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live)<br>
			White boy, white boy, in your cop car<br>
			(But I don't listen to her 'cause my head is like a sieve)<br>
			White boy, white boy, you're untouchable<br>
			(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)<br>
			Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a (big rockstar)<br>
			<br>

			Seems like the average lifespan of a white man<br>
			Is more than twice than a black life span<br>
			I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner<br>
			I feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance<br>
			I'd rather hear 'em say &quot;Die N-word&quot; than Die Antwoord<br>
			Ninja, now it's better disguised banter<br>
			But that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially<br>
			And can't find answers<br>
			We're applying, but McDonald's<br>
			Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire<br>
			So how can we have higher standards?<br>
			As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter<br>
			We fight back with violence but acts like that are<br>
			Black eyes on the movement<br>
			Which makes black lives madder<br>
			At cops and cops madder<br>
			That's why it's at a stalemate<br>
			Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops<br>
			I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops<br>
			The block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot<br>
			Call the attack dogs off of us, man<br>
			You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop<br>
			And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop<br>
			Sendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods<br>
			Who ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it<br>
			Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns<br>
			And know nobody black so they act afraid of us<br>
			And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em<br>
			A subconscious racist<br>
			Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?<br>
			'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area<br>
			Separated us, Section-Eight'd us<br>
			When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us<br>
			And education sucks, and every day's another<br>
			Freddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz<br>
			Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?<br>
			We just want a safe environment for our kids<br>
			But can't escape the sirens<br>
			Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in<br>
			The poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in<br>
			The lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence<br>
			And we're trapped in these racial biases<br>
			That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise<br>
			Every time we see a devil's face<br>
			Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my<br>
			It's more like billy clubs and gats<br>
			And we really love it when you think we're guilty 'cause we're black<br>
			&quot;But you kill each other, facts<br>
			You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats&quot;<br>
			Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse<br>
			While people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes<br>
			Fuck your Republican views<br>
			Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?<br>
			And streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics<br>
			Or be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black<br>
			You better be strapped with a derringer<br>
			Or be &quot;capped in America&quot; like Steve Rogers<br>
			'Cause no one oversees these cops and<br>
			All we see is 'em beat charges<br>
			We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off<br>
			So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings<br>
			Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress<br>
			But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance<br>
			If you try to slander the flag but<br>
			Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb<br>
			So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum<br>
			If you don't stand for the national anthem<br>
			We raise it, you better praise it<br>
			Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll<br>
			Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield<br>
			Home of the brave is still racist 'ville<br>
			So this whole nation feels like a plantation field<br>
			In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals<br>
			That had its Natives killed<br>
			Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel<br>
			To a piece of cloth that represents the &quot;Land of the Free&quot; that made people slaves to build
