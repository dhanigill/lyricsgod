			<h1>I Love You More</h1>
			<p>
			The more you, put me through,<br>
			The more it makes me wanna come back to you,<br>
			You say you hate me, I just love you more,<br>
			You don't want me, I just want you more,<br>
			I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,<br>
			I know it's sad but it's making me happy,<br>
			The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,<br>
			Cause you love me, and I love you more.<br>
			<br>

			It's sick, but who could ever predict,<br>
			We'd be doin' the same shit,<br>
			We say we do it for our baby but we don't,<br>
			We do it for us, it's lust,<br>
			Cause neither one of us trusts each other,<br>
			So we fuck 'til we bust,<br>
			Then we cuss each other, out,<br>
			We know what it's about,<br>
			Shout 'til I throw you out the house,<br>
			You throw me out the house,<br>
			I throw you on the couch,<br>
			Punch you in the mouth,<br>
			Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,<br>
			And apologize after,<br>
			Laughter, pain, it's insane,<br>
			We're back in the same chapter again,<br>
			And it's sad but it's true,<br>
			When I'm layin' here with you,<br>
			There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.<br>
			<br>

			Cause I hate you, do you hate me?<br>
			Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,<br>
			It makes me wanna just take you,<br>
			And just throw you on the bed,<br>
			And fuck you like I don't even know you,<br>
			You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,<br>
			You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,<br>
			We're both evil in our ways,<br>
			But neither one of us would ever admit it,<br>
			Cause one of us would have one up on the other,<br>
			So forget it,<br>
			We can make accusations, people spread rumors,<br>
			But they ain't got proof,<br>
			'Til they do it's just the two of us,<br>
			It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,<br>
			But you gotta believe me to a degree,<br>
			Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,<br>
			Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,<br>
			If I ran who would I run to,<br>
			That would be this soft and warm,<br>
			So it's off and on, usually more off than on,<br>
			But at least we know that we share this common bond,<br>
			You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,<br>
			I hope, the only reason that I cope,<br>
			Is cause of that fact,<br>
			And plus I can bust in that,<br>
			And that's why...<br>
			<br>

			I could never understand it,<br>
			That's why I don't try,<br>
			From junior high until we both die,<br>
			It's silly ho why must we try,<br>
			Is it really so rough,<br>
			That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,<br>
			Try to pull each other's legs,<br>
			Until the other begs,<br>
			We're liein' to ourselves,<br>
			That's the beauty of it yeah,<br>
			Cause we truly love each other,<br>
			That's why we always fight,<br>
			And all we do is shove each other,<br>
			Every other fuckin' night,<br>
			And it's clear it ain't gonna change,<br>
			It's pent up rage,<br>
			We both have,<br>
			We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,<br>
			We've both been,<br>
			Someone else's someone else,<br>
			Problem is neither one wants help,<br>
			It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,<br>
			Our family's mixed up,<br>
			There's a baby sister in the mix,<br>
			And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,<br>
			And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,<br>
			And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,<br>
			On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,<br>
			All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,<br>
			What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,<br>
			But I won't be made a fool of,<br>
			If this is true love,<br>
			You wouldn't do what,<br>
			You did last time,<br>
			You wouldn't screw up,<br>
			This time,<br>
			Cause this time girl,<br>
			I'm telling you what,<br>
			You do it again I'm fucking you up,<br>
			No matter what...<br>
			<br>

			What you say, what you do,<br>
			I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,<br>
			No matter where you run, I'll be right there,<br>
			Right behind you, in your nightmares,<br>
			All the flowers, and the candy,<br>
			All the times that you threw it back at me,<br>
			You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,<br>
			When you find out, can't escape me whore.<br>
