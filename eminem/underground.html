			A lot of people ask me<br>
			Where the fuck I've been at the last few years<br>
			Shit I don't know<br>
			But I do know - I'm back now.<br>

			Here comes the rain and thunder now<br>
			Nowhere to run, to run to now<br>
			I've disappeared, you'll wonder how<br>
			Looking for me, I'm underground<br>
			<br>

			Yes it can be, the fucking Antichrist back Danny and Satan in black satin panties<br>
			This is Amityville, calamity god damn it insanity pills fanny pack filled with Xanax<br>
			Through every nook and cranny looking for trannies<br>
			Milk and cookies spilled on my silk<br>
			Negligee lookie<br>
			Razor blades with me to make you bleed,<br>
			Cases of Maybelline make-up laying on the table of weed<br>
			Slim Shady shit sounds like a fable to me<br>
			Until he jumps out of the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee.<br>
			<br>

			Here comes the rain and thunder now<br>
			Nowhere to run, to run to now<br>
			I've disappeared, you'll wonder how<br>
			Looking for me, I'm underground<br>
			<br>
			Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair<br>
			Found at the back of a van after the shooting at the vanity fare<br>
			Hannah Montanna prepare to elope from a can opener and be cut open like a cantaloupe and canopy beds<br>
			Glad bags, yeah glad to be back, 'cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dead in rehab<br>
			Fucking doctor, I didn't understand a damn what he said I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch<br>

			Nowhere to run, to run to now<br>
			I've disappeared, you'll wonder how<br>
			Looking for me, I'm underground<br>
			<br>

			Walked up Elm street with a fucking wiffle bat drew fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissor Hands too<br>
			Came out with a little scratch, ooh<br>
			Looking like I got in a fucking pillow fight with a triple fat goose<br>
			Insanity, can it be vanity, where is the humanity<br>
			And having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee<br>
			Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets<br>
			With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it<br>
			Cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to,<br>
			Get it? Headed off to (haha)<br>
			Medic this headache's awful<br>
			This anesthetic is pathetic so is this diabetic waffle<br>
			And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco<br>

			Here comes the rain and thunder now<br>
			Nowhere to run, to run to now<br>
			I've disappeared, you'll wonder how<br>
			Looking for me, I'm underground<br>

			When you walked through the door you were queer to me<br>
			So come here baby boy, just come here to me<br>
