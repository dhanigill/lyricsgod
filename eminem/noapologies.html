			<h1>No Apologies</h1>
			<p>
			In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter<br>
			My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up<br>
			Arsenic writer, author with arthritis<br>
			Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis<br>
			Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,<br>
			Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick<br>
			Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics<br>
			Who wait for me to slip with it so quick<br>
			This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute<br>
			Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly<br>
			Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit<br>
			So stop dwelling and I am not failing<br>
			You fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly like (Beyonce's) pot belly<br>
			This is Destiny, yes money I'm off running<br>
			So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening<br>
			<br>

			No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry<br>
			You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me<br>
			No apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me<br>
			No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me<br>
			No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all<br>
			'til I get a call that god's coming<br>
			No apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny<br>
			I can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me, no apologies<br>

			<br>
			My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows<br>
			But these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow<br>
			I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me<br>
			I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs<br>
			I choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'<br>
			Fuck yeah I'm a basket case and I mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted, 'til my assassination,<br>
			'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation<br>
			44 mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then...<br>


			<br>
			This song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC<br>
			It's what it do just to see if he still has it<br>
			And if his skills mastered,<br>
			He's able to spill raps long after his killed, that's a real MC<br>
			Got you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly<br>
			You still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me<br>
			Then expect a longer life expectancy<br>
			I'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside<br>
			I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning<br>
			So I'm warning you, don't coax me<br>
			It's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing<br>
			Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled<br>
			The press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid<br>
			They don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded<br>
			All they did was ballooned it<br>
			I'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did<br>
			That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'<br>
			And they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', and you too, you can<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Expect no sympathy from me I'm an MC<br>
			This is how I'm supposed to be<br>
			Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat<br>
			So expect no apologies</p>
