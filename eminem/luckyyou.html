			<h1>Lucky You</h1>
			<p>
			Whoa, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
			<br>
			Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it<br>
			I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it<br>
			All my life I want a Grammy but I'll prolly never get it<br>
			I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon<br>
			Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules<br>
			I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose<br>
			Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food<br>
			Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you<br>
			Fuck you too, woo!<br>
			<br>
			Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move<br>
			Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice<br>
			Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot<br>
			Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice<br>
			<br>
			Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall<br>
			Turn my back on you, all of you finished<br>
			Back to these bullets, it's back to the job<br>
			Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'<br>
			Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'<br>
			These packs and I'm actually pumpin'<br>
			Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'<br>
			You mighta went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'<br>
			I'm actually buzzin' this time<br>
			Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine<br>
			I do not fuck with you guys<br>
			If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time<br>
			I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers<br>
			Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives<br>
			Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree<br>
			My twelve days of Christmas was nothin' but lies<br>
			I run at you hard like a sumo (sumo)<br>
			They say I talk like a chulo (chulo)<br>
			I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (woo)<br>
			Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (rah)<br>
			You play your cards, I reverse on you all<br>
			And I might just drop 4 like a Uno (bup)<br>
			Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo<br>
			They've invented a level up in the ghetto to ghetto<br>
			Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now<br>
			Shit get relevant until the beef die down<br>
			In truth a nigga just really want me tied down<br>
			I've been alone and I never needed nobody<br>
			Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down<br>
			Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle<br>
			I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now<br>
			I said ain't no love for the other side<br>
			Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)<br>
			When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope<br>
			You in the wrong cab down the wrong path<br>
			Nigga, wrong way, wrong road<br>
			Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast<br>
			I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower<br>
			<br>

			I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it<br>
			This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it<br>
			I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em<br>
			Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition<br>
			Fuck's the difference?<br>
			I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules<br>
			Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose<br>
			I been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full<br>
			I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me<br>
			Fuck you think? (woo!)<br>
			<br>
			I got a couple of mansions<br>
			Still I don't have any manners<br>
			You got a couple of ghost writers<br>
			But to these kids it don't actually matter<br>
			They're askin' me, &quot;What the fuck happened to hip-hop?&quot;<br>
			I said, &quot;I don't have any answers.&quot;<br>
			'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album<br>
			It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers<br>
			And actually comin' from humble beginnings<br>
			I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning<br>
			I wish I could say &quot;What a wonderful feeling!&quot;<br>
			&quot;We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!&quot;<br>
			But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability<br>
			To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me<br>
			The inability to pen humility<br>
			Hatata batata, why don't we make a bunch of<br>
			Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em!<br>
			Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular<br>
			Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up<br>
			Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck<br>
			About the ones that were here before you that made rap<br>
			Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks<br>
			ADATs, where the G Raps and Kanes at?<br>
			We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back<br>
			'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage<br>
			All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap<br>
			I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad<br>
			But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat<br>
			That would take that feed-back and aim back, I need that<br>
			But I think it's inevitable<br>
			They know what button to press or what lever to pull<br>
			To get me to snap though (lil bitch)<br>
			And if I'm payin' attention I'm probably makin' it bigger<br>
			But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (get it?)<br>
			On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'<br>
			Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits<br>
			I'm asleep at the wheel again<br>
			As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent<br>
			Of another beat I'ma kill again<br>
			'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again<br>
			Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin<br>
			It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram<br>
			And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again<br>
			Levels to this shit, I got an elevator<br>
			You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker<br>
			I sound like a broken record every time I break a record<br>
			Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater<br>
			Motherfucker now I got a right to be this way<br>
			I got spite inside my DNA<br>
			But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy<br>
			It's the moment y'all been waitin' for<br>
			Like California wishin' rain would pour<br>
			In that drought, y'all been prayin' for<br>
			My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw<br>
			Still the same Marshall, that outlaw<br>
			That they say as a writer might've fell off<br>
			I'm back on that bull like the cowboys<br>
			<br>
			So y'all gotta move (yeah), y'all gotta move (yeah)<br>
			<br>
			Y'all gotta move<br>
			Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice<br>
			Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot<br>
			Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice
