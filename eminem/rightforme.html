			<h1>Right For Me</h1>
			<p>
			I feel phenomenal as usual<br>
			Pharmaceuticals, glue stick to crucify me at Bonnaroo<br>
			But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston<br>
			In the corner trying to seek solitude<br>
			Shallow but such a hollow dude<br>
			I won't even swallow solid food<br>
			Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa<br>
			Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you<br>
			Roses to violet mollies are blue<br>
			Lost in a ball of confusion<br>
			Its all an illusion<br>
			It's probably the shrooms I'm on<br>
			Cause I think I started hallucinating<br>
			Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica and Odd Future's new shit<br>
			And all I can do is follow the music<br>
			And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza<br>
			Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover<br>
			Just a problem in wallowing fumes<br>
			I feel uptight I gotta get looser<br>
			After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution<br>
			Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted<br>
			Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit<br>
			Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed<br>
			You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze<br>
			But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer<br>
			It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like I'm Marshall<br>
			Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya<br>
			Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse<br>
			But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth<br>
			A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana<br>
			I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers<br>
			Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke<br>
			And a Rottweiler too, I'm not in the mood so<br>
			When I say I'm bringing the TEC out<br>
			I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers<br>
			God, I'm gonna puke<br>
			I'm so gone off the hookah<br>
			I think I swallowed a loofah<br>
			I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver<br>
			Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her<br>
			The thoughts I produce are loony tunes<br>
			The box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes<br>
			To replace next up Veronica's boobs<br>
			And a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box<br>
			In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues<br>
			The girl was just not the one suitable for him<br>
			<br>

			Right For Me will change me rearrange my head to be<br>
			Just right for you and me don�t laugh, please listen<br>
			Don�t laugh, please listen<br>
			<br>
			Thought I could endure the pressure<br>
			Collapse and crumble perhaps<br>
			Relapsing under that<br>
			Well that's a bunch of crap<br>
			In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap<br>
			And I'm sick of acting humble thats enough of that<br>
			Fuck that shit, cut the sack<br>
			Like its a natural reaction<br>
			That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match<br>
			Cause push keeps coming to that<br>
			I can keep getting my ass kicked, keep it coming back<br>
			Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit so mad<br>
			Disgruntled had some struggles yeah<br>
			But that passionate hunger's back<br>
			The fantastic juggling act<br>
			And the way I flip my tongue on the track<br>
			It's like verbal acrobatics<br>
			But in fact<br>
			Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic<br>
			I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft<br>
			After I strapped the duffel bag to my back<br>
			And stuck the massive punchin' bag in it<br>
			An elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack<br>
			And a piece of plastic bubble wrap<br>
			Went spastic and fuckin' snapped<br>
			Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid<br>
			Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped<br>
			And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat<br>
			And for my last trick, lunge on back lash<br>
			On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half<br>
			Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal<br>
			And just asked him to come crash<br>
			And I go grab my go-go-gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress<br>
			And ceramic construction hat<br>
			Rubbed my magic mushroom tat<br>
			Fell off then splat, get up from that<br>
			Face taped to a waste paper basket<br>
			Throw up then gas, lungs collapse<br>
			And that's more likely than finding someone that's<br>
			<br>

			Couple of shots of J�ger<br>
			Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation<br>
			Flooded with thoughts of anger<br>
			While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'<br>
			&quot;You're top ten ain't cha?&quot; stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy<br>
			And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation<br>
			Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous<br>
			Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is<br>
			I came to fuck with your occupation<br>
			You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs<br>
			And you brought the scalpel and sponge<br>
			The oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon<br>
			Stuck in the operating room<br>
			Once you done, swapped your name with him<br>
			Smuggled in Ronald Reagan<br>
			If you duck him up Donald Fagen<br>
			While juggling waffles baking<br>
			Fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle<br>
			They flung it across the table<br>
			Then bump it and knock it shake it<br>
			Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration<br>
			I said fuck it and lost my patience<br>
			Since they all woke up from sedation<br>
			Ain't none of you Doctor Dre<br>
			So then what does it got you thinkin'<br>
			That you can fuck with this operation<br>
			Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing<br>
			I'm still pluggin' along<br>
			No need for an assumption<br>
			Here's confirmation<br>
			I'm up for the long duration<br>
			I'm just looking for something to walk away with<br>
			Some pocket change and a little integrity<br>
			Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage<br>
			Till I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and<br>
			Stuck in an awkward place in my life<br>
			But I shit you not like I'm fucked up with constipation<br>
			That day will come before I stumble upon some ladies<br>
			<br>
