			<h1>Never Enough</h1>
			<p>
			There's not much you could do or say to phase me<br>
			People think I'm a little bit crazy<br>
			I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll<br>
			Have to step in every once in a while to save me<br>
			To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things<br>
			Sometimes I forget what other people just may think<br>
			A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me<br>
			If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me<br>
			I maybe a little too fast paced and racy<br>
			Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times<br>
			cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing<br>
			And I could give a fuck what category you place me<br>
			Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone<br>
			As long as you place me amongst one of them greats<br>
			When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z<br>
			For every single die hard fan who embraced me<br>
			I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me<br>
			And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me<br>
			Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me<br>
			In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me<br>
			It only made me what I am today, see<br>
			Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me<br>
			You ain't gonna make or break me<br>
			Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G<br>
			You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening<br>
			Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me<br>
			And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me<br>
			You had all this time to think about it<br>
			Now don't pussy out and try to about face me<br>
			Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day<br>
			That we finally meet in the same place to see<br>
			<br>

			No matter how many battles I been in and won<br>
			No matter how many magazines on my nuts<br>
			No matter how many MC's I eat up<br>
			Ooh ooh, it's never enough<br>
			<br>

			My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it<br>
			Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics<br>
			You go say the wrong shit and get your face split<br>
			The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it<br>
			I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit<br>
			Graze it, your peace talk, save it<br>
			You shit sounds dated, you're overrated<br>
			I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers<br>
			If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse<br>
			Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?<br>
			I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it<br>
			To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic<br>
			My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it<br>
			Chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it<br>
			Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it<br>
			When it's hot, it's hot<br>
			Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it<br>
