			<h1>Cold Wind Blows</h1>
			<p>
			Cause some things just don't change<br>
			Cause some things just don't change<br>
			It's better when they stay the same<br>
			Although the whole world knows your name<br>
			So on a bigger stage<br>
			They came to see you spit your game<br>
			<br>
			But it shouldn't be difficult to explain<br>
			Just why you came back again, you hate the fame<br>
			Love the game, cold as ice you remain<br>
			Fuck 'em all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again<br>
			<br>
			So, god damn... is it that time again already<br>
			Ha-ha, you don't look too happy to see me<br>
			Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once<br>
			All right, fuck y'all then<br>
			<br>
			You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts<br>
			Michael Vick in this bitch, dog fall back you mutts<br>
			Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy<br>
			Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mummy<br>
			And my nuts, licked, gobble 'em up trick, yummy<br>
			Bitch you don't fucking think I know that you suck dick dummy?<br>
			You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey<br>
			Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny!<br>
			Shorty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words<br>
			You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker<br>
			Motherfucker might as well let my lips pucker<br>
			Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker<br>
			The shit is on, 'cause you went and pissed me off<br>
			Now I'm shitting and pissing on everybody<br>
			Give a fuck if it's right or wrong<br>
			So buck the Buddha, light a bong<br>
			But take a look at Mariah<br>
			Next time I inspire you to write a song, c'mon<br>
			<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh,<br>
			I'm as cold as the cold wind blows<br>
			When it snows and it's twenty below<br>
			Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know<br>
			I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh<br>
			<br>
			Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth<br>
			Y'all are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing<br>
			I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out<br>
			Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker<br>
			I'll show you pussy-footing, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt<br>
			'Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion<br>
			Who the fuck is you pushin', you must've mistook me for some sissy<br>
			Soft punk looking for some nookie or bosom<br>
			Go ahead, fucking hater push me<br>
			I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me<br>
			Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy<br>
			Man the fuck up sissy, G's up<br>
			All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (Shady ease up!)<br>
			Man chill, nah I can't god dammit<br>
			Rap is a landfill, drop the anvil<br>
			These are shoes that you can't fill<br>
			Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning<br>
			And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still<br>
			During an earthquake, urine in your face<br>
			'Cause you're fake, ah what the fuck, that hurt wait!<br>
			Ah what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening<br>
			Alright then I quit, god I give up<br>
			Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do<br>
			This is for your sins, I cleanse you<br>
			You can repent but I warn you, if you continue<br>
			To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said<br>
			<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh,<br>
			I'm as cold as the cold wind blows<br>
			When it snows and it's twenty below<br>
			Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know<br>
			I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh<br>
			<br>
			How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day<br>
			'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say<br>
			So long, 'til then I drop the fucking bombs<br>
			Like I miss the pass when I went long<br>
			If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong<br>
			Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song<br>
			Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women<br>
			When Aquaman drowns and the human torch starts swimming<br>
			Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo<br>
			So don't compare me to them other bums over there<br>
			It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah<br>
			I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair<br>
			But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you<br>
			I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune<br>
			The last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme<br>
			And say I was writing this and I thought of you so<br>
			<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh,<br>
			I'm as cold as the cold wind blows<br>
			When it snows and it's twenty below<br>
			Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know<br>
			I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh<br>
			<br>
			Oh oh oh oh oh oh<br>
			I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this way<br>
			I don't know, I don't know but I'll probably be this way 'til my dying day<br>
			I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold mean things I don't mean to say<br>
			I guess this is how you made me</p>
