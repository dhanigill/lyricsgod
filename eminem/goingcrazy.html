			<h1>Going Crazy</h1>
			<p>
			Fame, fame, fame<br>
			I think it's got me goin' crazy<br>
			Ohhhohhh<br>
			I get lost in this game, game, game<br>
			I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers<br>
			Ohhhohhh<br>
			Keep speaking my name, name, name<br>
			You gon' have reason to hate me<br>
			Yeahhhheahhh<br>
			It's like. you. don't. want. me to win<br>
			So. this. time. I'm goin' in!<br>
			<br>

			This the life of a rocker<br>
			jagermeister and vodka<br>
			Hoppin' off of the club's balcony<br>
			Into the crowd, surfin'<br>
			And when they drop me, I'm randomly sockin' fans<br>
			And when my interviews in hockey masks,<br>
			Slap the journalists on their ass<br>
			I'm high off speed,<br>
			Drivin' my car at high speed<br>
			Pocket full of weed, while lesbians follow me<br>
			I'm in the studio, envy<br>
			My h &amp; m, gon' call for me<br>
			Cause I fell asleep on the soundboard, ain't get us off a week<br>
			So let's Bang!! all up in my head<br>
			Get 'em back ungrateful dead<br>
			Bustin' in the air, with 30 bitches up in my bed<br>
			I'm kickin' 'em out naked, and this the sympathy<br>
			Just ask me why I did it, well fuck it I can't remember<br>
			<br>

			Fame, fame, fame<br>
			I think it's got me goin' crazy<br>
			Ohhhohhh<br>
			I get lost in this game, game, game<br>
			I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers<br>
			Ohhhohhh<br>
			Keep speaking my name, name, name<br>
			You gon' have reason to hate me<br>
			Yeahhhheahhh<br>
			It's like. you. don't. want. me to win<br>
			So. this. time. I'm goin' in!<br>
			<br>

			Some boys are wallin<br>
			Drinkin', cussin', and hyper smilin'<br>
			Been ridin' for days, tour bus look like ryker's island<br>
			Hand me jack daniel's, spray paintin' the die hard fan<br>
			Little cocker spaniel, fresh out of the damn zoo<br>
			Man you, better be conscious, I'm backstage<br>
			Livin' it up, with a couple of sluts feelin' nautious<br>
			We're drinkin' it's been a couple of days, since I've slept<br>
			My dick is sore from fuckin', when I bust there's nothin' left<br>
			Just dust, back on the stage, give me my microphone<br>
			Strappin' with the audience as we perform hypersong<br>
			Our label presented us with a plaque<br>
			Brought it on stage, and bashed it to pieces with an aluminum bats, stanks<br>
			Now which one of you bitches down for the cause<br>
			Yeah I said my dick is sore but I ain't say shit about my balls<br>
			Last call then we off to the next city, yeah<br>
			Whatever I didn't drink on my bladder pack it up and take the rest with me<br>
			<br>

			Fame, fame, fame<br>
			I think it's got me goin' crazy<br>
			Ohhhohhh<br>

			<br>

			Yeah this game has got me goin' crazy<br>
			Fuck it, I am crazy<br>
			What's new, what kinda fuckin' glue you'd think I'd be if I was glue<br>
			We lost proof, he was our crew's glue<br>
			But where was you, when we were fallin' apart<br>
			You were shittin on us too<br>
			But no one but us knew we were beefin'<br>
			Cause that's what happens when you beef with crew<br>
			It stays in the crew, cause it's just crew<br>
			But we're back now, yeah we took our time while our blood grew<br>
			Only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you!<br>
			And we're back, these days if you don't got the guts or the nuts to<br>
			Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you<br>
			Ahh choo!<br>
			Bless you! I'm allergic to pussy, sluts too<br>
			Yeah, you think you the shit, till we flush you<br>
			Have some bullshit to readjust<br>
			Still got a just a few of us left, but it'd be unjust to rob us our just due<br>
			So rest in peace to Bugz and proof<br>
			This one's for you homies, we love you<br>
			But we can't stop now we done had too much of our blood drew from this...<br>
			<br>

			Fame, fame, fame<br>
