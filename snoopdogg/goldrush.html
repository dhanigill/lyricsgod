			<h1>Gold Rush</h1>
			<p>
			Josey Wales was known for robbin trains and things<br>
			layin everybody down for diamond rings and chains<br>
			It remains the same in the year you live in, see<br>
			Cos if I pull out some heat, nigga, you'll go kick in<br>
			And that's just the rules set by the fool from the ol' school<br>
			When it's time to duel, you get two men<br>
			Two heaters, one street, one clock<br>
			and when it strike twelve one of y'all gon' drop<br>
			If you're quick on the draw you're gon' see the morgue<br>
			but if you're too slow<br>
			I catch you on the downlow (Oh no)<br>
			Oh no, you mean The Kid, shit's real<br>
			I ain't no John Wayne, these niggas gangbang<br>
			The Four Horsemen, that's the click I'm wit<br>
			You mean the little bitty niggas with the itchy trigger fingers<br>
			Yeah, we're on a mission ta Kansas, slippin thru Texas<br>
			We stopped at Bonanza to get us some hot cakes<br>
			bacon and eggs, and then we slip in the whorehouse to get us some leg<br>
			Hop back on the horses, enforcers of courses<br>
			The niggas in black, the fearless Four Horsemen<br>
			Searchin for this location on the map<br>
			The gold rush, baby, got ta have it (I gots ta have it)<br>
			It feels just like it's 1865<br>
			and a trigger look-a-day is how I ride<br>

			<br>
			On and on and on it's more strange<br>
			Time to heat, shootin range<br>
			Quick with the heat on their hip<br>
			Young Jesse James come to test your aim<br>
			I seen you at th e Wild Horny Corral<br>
			I hearda ya name<br>
			Tha forcify, nigga you ain't never lie<br>
			Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride<br>
			From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach<br>
			My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts<br>
			The off-the-rocker roller coaster<br>
			On a six-shooter holster<br>
			with DPG on every Wanted poster<br>
			Let me think about which bank to gank<br>
			which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank<br>
			I want all the shit you got in stacks<br>
			attached to this skirt in the corner<br>
			so I snatched the bitch in the back<br>
			The Dogg in me feels for the lust<br>
			but the hogg in me makes me wanna bust<br>
			Back to the drawin down board<br>
			Nowadays we drawn down more<br>
			To survive thru all the round wards<br>
			Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene<br>
			or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen<br>
			I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it<br>
			With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket<br>
			Like that cock back<br>
			quick to pull my strap<br>
			Just to put the Horsemen on the map<br>
			(The gold rush)<br>

			<br>
			Born is Doggystyle, individual, James got the hots<br>
			I got the six shots for all the plans and plots<br>
			I gots lots o' cash stashed in money bags<br>
			Worthy workers for all the Russian blabbermouths and gags<br>
			I got stacks so my stacks excell<br>
			Hop in the coach wit my twelve Clydesdales and bells<br>
			I'm on the move, smooth, to my decoy horse<br>
			A 30-30 on my side to shoot a nigga o' course<br>
			It ain't no stoppin young Josey<br>
			Box all the nosey<br>
			Headed to the saloon with my platoon where all the hos be<br>
			Left a dusty trail, bailed in swell<br>
			Gold spurs on the Gators, set back the clientele<br>
			Oh well, for the recop I drop my bet<br>
			Divide between my homies and ride the sunset<br>

			<br>
			Two sacks o' money from the train heist<br>
			They ain't even counted it up<br>
			just mounted it up<br>
			Rode west toward the coaster, six-shooters in the holster<br>
			Pass thru a run-down town whose walls hold my poster<br>
			Closer I get ta death which is every second makes me sweat<br>
			so I gotta have what I can get<br>
			Heard word about the gold rush and headed West<br>
			on my white horsey with three straps in my napsack<br>
			Giddy up, the next town I rode thru<br>
			I had to threaten to blow their city up<br>
			Undebts with Chief Black, caught five miles west<br>
			sell us some beads and hail us some weed<br>
			He offered me a toke<br>
			he didn't have a 20 he had they beads-pipe smoke<br>
			I almost choked<br>
			Break him for the get, right, I'm off into the sunset<br>
			tryin ta reach my destiny fast<br>
			It's these two bags o' cash<br>
			44's cocked I ain't makin no mo' stops<br>
			till I hit the spot, I made it twelve on the dot<br>
			I slid off my boots, counted my loot<br>
			Five minutes after the strike of midnight<br>
			I counted 200 Gs, I cocked my strap and slept tight<br>
			(At the gold rush, at the gold rush<br>
			at the gold rush, at the gold rush<br>			</p>
