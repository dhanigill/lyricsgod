			<h1>Secret</h1>
			<p>
			Woah woah woah woah woah woah woah<br>
			I got to snoop, so cold<br>
			Big Snoop (Battlecat, Snoop Dogg)<br>
			<br>

			I hear the sercrets that you keep<br>
			When you're talking in your sleep<br>
			I hear the secrets that you keep<br>
			When you're talking in your sleep<br>
			<br>

			When you close your eyes and you go to sleep<br>
			That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep<br>
			I'mma get you before you get me<br>
			Them niggas that you hang with are so weak<br>
			You're talking shit about me<br>
			Turn around and you're the homie<br>
			Man that shit is phoney<br>
			Tried to set me up bro<br>
			But you were singing to my hoe<br>
			<br>

			From a nigga to a dub<br>
			From a g to a scrub<br>
			I'm a vet on the set<br>
			I'mma show you what it was<br>
			Y'all flipping out, trippin' out<br>
			Cause I took a different route<br>
			6-2 rag, hell yeah come dippin' out<br>
			Beach city rider, 85'er, eastsider<br>
			Ain't none of y'all niggas live-er<br>
			I hear the bad shit that y'all talk<br>
			You want to catch me out of pocket but I can't get caught<br>
			I'mma show you what a bitch thought, a bitch taught<br>
			A nigga got played out and layed out in chalk<br>
			It's a cold game<br>
			It's like a rap riddle<br>
			Nine times out of ten a bitch was in the middle<br>
			Most neighborhoods started off cool<br>
			In the eighties it was Long Beach fool<br>
			With no seperation<br>
			Here's a toast to the real shit, the foundation<br>
			You know my game is amazing<br>
			I keep blazing<br>
			Eastside niggas is the craziest and the shadiest<br>
			Yeah dawg, tell 'em again<br>
			What you talking 'bout loc?<br>
			I got hell of a ends<br>
			<br>

			Hell boss<br>
			Hoping that her smiling exes fall (ego hustling loopholes)<br>
			I'd always thought that you would've never have stabbed me everywhere<br>
			<br>

			More rumours, more lies<br>
			More money, more time<br>
			I don't really give a fuck cause you all gon' shine<br>
			So you better get yours and quit worrying 'bout mine<br>
			I see it in your voice and I hear it in your eyes<br>
			So jealous, so envious<br>
			What a drag<br>
			Real talk loc, you ain't acting like a man<br>
			Your message is how blessed you is<br>
			I guess you is<br>
			Look at the mess you in<br>
			<br>

			When you close your eyes and you go to sleep<br>
			That's when I ride, late night I be on the creep<br>
			I'mma get you before you get me<br>
			Them niggas that you hang with are so weak<br></p>
