			<h1>Doggy Doggy World</h1>
			<p>
			It's like everywhere I look, and everywhere I go<br>
			I'm hearin motherfuckers tryin to steal my flow<br>
			But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio<br>
			Put me up on the game when I step through the do'<br>
			Ya know, some of these niggaz is so deceptive<br>
			Usin my styles like a contraceptive<br>
			I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt<br>
			It's the nick nack patty wack, I still got the bigger sack<br>
			So put your gun away, run away, cuz i'm back (why?)<br>
			Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now<br>
			Tell me what's goin on<br>
			It make me wanna holler, cuz my dollars come in ozones<br>
			Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes<br>
			and quit tryin to spit at my motherfuckin hoes<br>
			Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point<br>
			You think you got the bomb cuz I rolled you a joint<br>
			You'se a flea and i'm the big Dogg<br>
			I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin paws<br>
			Y'alls, niggaz, better recognize<br>
			And see where I'm comin from it's still East Side till I die<br>
			Why ask why?  As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y<br>

			<br>
			It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World<br>
			It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World<br>
			The Dogg's World<br>

			<br>
			Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten <br>
			See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin<br>
			Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers<br>
			Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors<br>
			Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin<br>
			I had your whole fuckin block bumpin<br>
			Don't sweat, but check the tecnique, I'm unique like China<br>
			Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya<br>
			So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through<br>
			One-two, three, you can't see me<br>
			I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics<br>
			A fuckin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets<br>
			It's on again, it's on and poppin<br>
			All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin<br>
			I wanna see some panties droppin<br>
			I'm comin from L.A., she used to chill with Dre up in Compton<br>
			(All I ever did was just use that hoe<br>
			 Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)<br>
			I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news<br>
			Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes<br>
			Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs<br>
			and I smoke weed for the fuck of it<br>
			Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked<br>
			but it's manditory that I kick it<br>
			Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it<br>
			Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin and movin<br>
			Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin<br>
			Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn<br>
			Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin<br>
			Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action<br>
			You really don't know, do you, you fuckin wit a hog<br>
			You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog<br>

			 <br>
			Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)<br>
			Tell when (till the early morn)<br>
			It don't stop (and uh) it don't quit (for the)<br>
			The Dogg Pound clique (to drop the cavvy Dogg shit)<br>
			<br>
			Diggity Daz out of the motherfuckin cut once mo'<br>
			So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow<br>
			I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick<br>
			Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)<br>
			Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about <br>
			the city where I'm from, dum diddy dum<br>
			As you groove to the gangster shit<br>
			The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique<br>
			Now as the Pound break it down with the gangsta funk<br>
			I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want<br>
			So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high<br>
			I promise I'll smoke chronic till the day that I die<br></p>
