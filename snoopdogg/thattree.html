			<h1>That Tree</h1>
			<p>
			Snoopy, is what they say as if they knew me<br>
			Groupies on my head like a kooflee, my nigga kid cudi,<br>
			That's my little buddy,<br>
			Call some hoe's up and get some cudi cudi,<br>
			What yo life like, mine is kinda tight,<br>
			A long way from hustlin, a china white,<br>
			My people love, the fans love me I'm all go,<br>
			If you ain't showin love then what did you call for,<br>
			I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price,<br>
			So alike and in need of my wife, smoke till I'm gone,<br>
			Dog on the throne I'm world-wide known and a boss in the zone,<br>
			I get it how I get it cause I can, I earn the spot,<br>
			You see the plans, I'm just fuckin with my fans,<br>
			I turned out to be a better man, important for life,<br>
			You understand while I'm puffin on this gram<br>
			<br>

			Everything I'm havin, no there ain't necessity,<br>
			Though I'm shining, keep on grinding what you see ain't all of me,<br>
			Though I keep them hoe's, don't love them hoe's,<br>
			The code in which I roll, it's so simple what I need,<br>
			I keep my Fam and I can't forget that tree,<br>
			Nah nah nah nah nah nah,<br>
			I can't forget that tree,<br>
			Nah nah nah nah nah nah,<br>
			I can't forget that tree,<br>
			Nah nah nah nah nah nah,<br>
			I can't forget that tree,<br>
			Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br>
			Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah<br>
			<br>

			I got my fam dog, look at my niggas,<br>
			Got little money dogg but I ain't tripping,<br>
			Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated,<br>
			Steady wanting freaky hoes, then I want a lady,<br>
			Holdin' the fam down and the clothes on me,<br>
			The people who were there, stupid sucka left me lonely,<br>
			Phony, when you see me nigga, don't approach me,<br>
			Made it to the top baby, that's on me,<br>
			Cops trying to claim that they made me,<br>
			I want you to feel another real for gaizing,<br>
			I keep it one hundred, never frontin, don't need me,<br>
			I'm in the zone, no place for pussy my nigga,<br>
			Cool yo that niggas don't know, loco how a nigga like me postpone,<br>
			The one fans loved, who was always approachable yo,<br>
			And I rep the double O, smoking, eating cherrios<br>
			<br>

			Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king,<br>
			And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it, all out in public,<br>
			The people want to touch it, I need a blunt with the stuffin',<br>
			Nigga, it's nuthin for me to chill out and post up at the house,<br>
			With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies,<br>
			Hollywood nice now,<br>
			Everyone want me and on the blogs they talk shit like they know me,<br>
			Fool, I'll take you niggas to school, &quot;How to get rich and stay cool&quot;,<br>
			Snoopy D O Dub show you homie, even with the critics and feds on me,<br>
			I was tappin all the Choanies,<br>
			Dog, but my folks call me snoopy, boss dogg nigga sue me,<br>
			Pony tail swinging as I lay in the jacuzzi,<br>
			Love of my life while I'm puffing on the good weed<br>
			<br>

			Snoop dogg in the house tonight blowing that laker crip that I know you like, right?<br>
			Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now Would you? Would you? Right?</p>
