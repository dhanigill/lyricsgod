			<h1>Lay Low</h1>
			<p>
			Ay ay Snoop whattup? This your nigga Dre<br>
			Ay man I was thinkin I ain't said shit on your whole motherfuckin album<br>
			So check it out, put this on there:<br>
			All you motherfuckin haters out there, can suck my motherfuckin dick!<br>
			And we still smokin, what?!<br>
			<br>
			<i>[Chorus: Nate Dogg]</i><br>
			For the nigga who be talkin loud and holdin his dick<br>
			Talkin shit, he better LAY LOW<br>
			For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick<br>
			Now she sick, she better LAY LOW<br>
			For the niggaz who be claimin my hood<br>
			and really ain't from my gang, better LAY LOW<br>
			I hope he don't be thinkin I'm just talkin<br>
			and I won't do a thing, really HOPE SO!<br>
			<br>

			Hmm, lay low, nobody move until I say so<br>
			Limo tint rollin deep like the President<br>
			See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch (beitch)<br>
			I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse<br>
			We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate<br>
			Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stoppin this<br>
			Whatever the case, I ain't tryin to catch it<br>
			Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records<br>
			Unseen but well heard, do not disturb<br>
			The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word<br>
			I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge<br>
			from the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke<br>
			I bring the worst from the L.B.C.<br>
			Smash motherfuckers thinkin they gon' smash on me<br>
			Snoop and Dre give a FUCK about what y'all say<br>
			From the &quot;World's Most Dangerous Group&quot; - N.W.A<br>
			Ay, ay<br>
			<br>

			Our rise, it was no surprise<br>
			I always knew these fools would trip<br>
			Hatin, fakin, schemin on mine<br>
			and on the down low talkin shit<br>
			Best move cause I refuse to lose<br>
			no matter which damn road I choose<br>
			So lay low cause you might be bruised<br>
			Top story on the evening news<br>
			I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low<br>
			Lay down on the floor<br>
			I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know<br>
			That's what I came fo'<br>
			<br>

			Where that nigga who be talkin shit?<br>
			He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch<br>
			I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezin the tits<br>
			Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips<br>
			She tried to make me cum, but I was tryin to take her home<br>
			Dropped you off and seen you fishin on your raggedy Brougham<br>
			Coulda thumped you and the dog (you little fag)<br>
			And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong<br>
			<br>

			Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya<br>
			From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya<br>
			Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with?<br>
			The same click he came with and made the game flip<br>
			Now niggaz grow they hair, hope they stayin act hard<br>
			That's even tho' yo' CEO talk shit get slapped hard<br>
			The backyard is where we get our scrap on<br>
			The black car drive by then you get capped on<br>
			<br>

			Whassup pimpin? It's P and Snoop<br>
			With Dre on the beat, this ain't nuttin but loot<br>
			They call me Jackhammer for all the bread I got<br>
			but they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got<br>
			I keeps it real-ah, cause I'm all about my scrilla<br>
			The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta<br>
			It's, No Limit til I D-I-E<br>
			C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be<br>			</p>
