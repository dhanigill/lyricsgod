			Get our dance on, Fred Astaire, Faye Dunaway<br>
			Eyes on us while we move to the clap<br>
			I'm nice with the dance and I'm smooth with the rap<br>
			We in the zone with the lights and glamour<br>
			Glass full of Patron, the code is grammar<br>

			On a slow drift, bubble like a fo'-fifth<br>
			And everybody everybody notice<br>
			So to cool cool Calvin Broadus<br>
			And every woman is a goddess<br>
			And every rapper is a artist<br>
			Yeah right, you're dead wrong, just sing along<br>
			It's Godzilla for reala my nigga, King Kong<br>
			Givin niggaz the blues<br>
			As I'm walkin on these fools in my blue suede tennis shoes<br>
