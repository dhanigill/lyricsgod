			<h1>Oh No</h1>
			<p>
			Everytime I come around they like &quot;Oh No&quot;<br>
			I get to trippin; slap the clip up in my 44<br>
			Shit I been thru in my hood made my heart cold<br>
			I get to poppin off that thang like I'm loco<br>
			No sense in coppin pleas when you see my knife out (knife out)<br>
			Motherfuckers light out (lights out)<br>
			<br>
			Here comes Snoop, uh (oh shit) (Oh No)<br>
			Sup Nigga, sup now, huh? (Oh No)<br>
			<br>

			Ricky Ticky Timble, C's is the symbol<br>
			Courdoroy khakis, stacies &amp; brimmed up<br>
			Straight razors just to keep you trimmed up<br>
			1-8-7, oh yeah, now you remember<br>
			He's electrifyin &amp; original<br>
			So gangster, Snoop Dogg the criminal<br>
			The one you hate to love, in the club, in the cut<br>
			Hugged up wit yo bitch, nigga I don't give a shit<br>
			You betta check dat ho, that's what wreckin G<br>
			Now step your game down, cause ain't no checkin me<br>
			You'll be respectin me until you leave this room<br>
			Or my gat'll go boom, bullets go zoom<br>
			Now your names on a tomb<br>
			They pourin out liqour wit no room to consume, you silly bafoon<br>
			I pop niggas like balloons, I ain't feelin em<br>
			Walkin in my big blue chucks cause I'm killin em<br>
			<br>
			 Hey whaddup cuz, it's 50 cent;<br>
			What's happnin nigga?<br>
			<br>

			Ever since the moment I was born I been dyin (Yea)<br>
			Hundred miles an hour pulse flyin wit my eye... an<br>
			He who fears fate lives like a coward<br>
			You go against me, you'll be devoured<br>
			Then you get to poppin you'll have a change of heart<br>
			I hit your chest a couple times you'll have to change your heart<br>
			Have doc usin donors, dead niggas with spare parts<br>
			You come back wit lungs of a snitch, an the heart of a dead nark<br>
			Niggas never see the light till it spark<br>
			Then they bleed, it get cold, then shit get dark<br>
			You can call me the beast from the east, I run these streets<br>
			You can eat hollow tip shells or you can work for me<br>
			These rap niggas crazy, my mercy has limits<br>
			Push Me - a hundred revolvers'll get to spinnin<br>
			Your services are no longer needed; Rock-a-bye baby<br>
			My bitch'll do it to you with a lil 380 (Yea)<br>
			<br>

			I'm bailin thru the door again<br>
			Let the Momo pour again<br>
			Me &amp; my ho again<br>
			Yea she got the four up in this motherfucker<br>
			And Imma bust it if you try to rush us or touch us or sucka duck us<br>
			It'll crack off, Now back off - real slow<br>
			An if you don't know, I never hesitate to shoot a ho<br>
			Yea that's my reputation - you test my patience &amp;<br>
			You &amp; your fam - bam - gon hear the blam, blam<br>
			Goddammit I'm at it again<br>
			They done let that bitch nigga up outta the pen<br>
			And now he lookin for me - what the heck - my game is built on respect<br>
			Now I'm breathin down your mortherfuckin neck<br>
			I dumps till my clips is empty<br>
			I'm headin down Willshire to San Vicente<br>
			And when I get there don't ask who sent me<br>
			Just take dem shots an drop it like it's hot<br>
			Bitch Nigga<br>
