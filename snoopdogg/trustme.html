			Hmm, I spent the night at the homie's house, shit<br>
			Slept in his livingroom, on his couch<br>
			Nigga high'n a motherfucker burnt out (shit)<br>
			Before you know it, god damn, the homie chirped out (damn!)<br>
			And he ain't said shit, he just dip in his Seville as he peel<br>
			Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?<br>
			Now baby got a gown on, gettin her clown on<br>
			As she slid downstairs, now she takin me down home<br>
			Cheatin in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom<br>
			Am I wrong? Shit, on and on and on and on<br>
			Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you<br>
			His baby momma in my face, she shakin poo-poo, what would you do?<br>
			Trust is a motherfuckin loco, shit<br>
			and so is temptation, and I don't know what I'ma do<br>
			Come on through (come on through) so I can cum on you (cum on you)<br>
			Shit if the homey knew (if the homey knew) if the homey knew<br>
