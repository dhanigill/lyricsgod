			<h1>Slow Down</h1>
			<p>
			JSlow down cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(Slow down baby, slow down baby)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets<br>
			Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(Ohhhhhhhhh, slow down)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets<br>
			<br>

			Life ain't nothing but a big old twist<br>
			A lot of times when I'm smoking <br>
			I'm doing that just to reminisce<br>
			It's funny, on how shit be<br>
			A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me<br>
			But look here, I work hard for all the things I got<br>
			And to hang with a nigga's just an intricate plot<br>
			You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes<br>
			And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors<br>
			But look here dog, a hoe once told me loc<br>
			Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke<br>
			Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it with rich niggas<br>
			Nigga we seven figure niggas<br>
			And we bigger than the biggest hip hop niggas in rap<br>
			And when we get to spittin' make sure y'all step back<br>
			You with that? Cause if you ain't clown,<br>
			We from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down<br>
			<br>
			Slow down (slow down now) cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(I can't take the heat, I can't take the heat)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets<br>
			Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(Ohhhhhhhhhh, slow down)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets<br>
			<br>

			Ayyo Snoop (I used to)<br>
			I used to cook up dope, ride with niggas<br>
			Know about the hits, hang with killas<br>
			Take the broads down for the jailhouse visits<br>
			Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga<br>
			Have the card parties where the stakes was high<br>
			Go shopping hit the club and then ???<br>
			Never had a day without no drama<br>
			Half the OG's age, but they call me Mama<br>
			Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag<br>
			Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad<br>
			I never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real<br>
			Until my best friend Jill got killed and then I<br>
			Dropped to my knees and called to the Lord<br>
			Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard<br>
			And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child<br>
			When I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down<br>
			<br>
			Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(Slow down baby)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby)<br>
			Slow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(Slow down, slow down)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets<br>
			<br>

			Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut<br>
			And started putting all this game on records for my come up<br>
			From sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money<br>
			Hata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me<br>
			It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul<br>
			Every body seemed glad, but now they ?????<br>
			Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free<br>
			And Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down<br>
			Snoop:<br>
			I got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun<br>
			I ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun<br>
			But it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round<br>
			The clown bound to dump, young chump<br>
			You don't wanna get caught up in my mix<br>
			Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch<br>
			We don't neva eva, talk no shit<br>
			Unless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit<br>
			<br>
			Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas<br>
			Slow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down<br>
			(I can't take the heat)<br>
			It's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)<br>
			Slow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat<br>
			Slow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets<br>
			Slow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat<br>
			(Slow down) Slow down<br>
			Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas<br>
			Slow down slow down<br>
			Slow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas			</p>
