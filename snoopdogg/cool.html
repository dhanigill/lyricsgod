			<h1>Cool</h1>
			<p>
			Just yesterday I had to turn a bitch away<br>
			I got to many on my side - I got to many in my face<br>
			Come ride with me<br>
			Take you where the gangstas play<br>
			Often heard but seldom seen<br>
			Thats the way that its supposed to be<br>
			When you do see me<br>
			Mobbin wit a gangsta lean<br>
			Got a piece by my side<br>
			You can ride baby close your eyes girl<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			I'm so cool<br>
			Cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool.....cool<br>
			<br>

			It's me I'm back again<br>
			It's never gonna end<br>
			I know y'all heard it all before<br>
			I just gotta give ya more<br>
			Catch me rollin in the night<br>
			If I turn off my lights<br>
			The eastsidaz in the game<br>
			You hear my voice and know my name<br>
			You should bang this down on your block<br>
			All through your hood<br>
			Burnin trees...burnin trees<br>
			Ladies let the music run right through you<br>
			Just like I'll do - Butch Cassidy<br>
			<br>

			I'm so cool I that I sweat ice cubes when I'm heated up<br>
			Take this move, this groove and still G it up<br>
			Stroll so slow you swore my leg was broke<br>
			Pimpin hoes down south, back east to west coast<br>
			Im Tracy Dee but think of me as mr. freeze<br>
			Gangsta leanin on the scene on them twisted deez<br>
			Big ballin mad doggin like a gangsta ride<br>
			As I exit I step with my stacey shine<br>
			I'm so cool but motherfcukers know I'm a fool<br>
			Ten times outta ten catch me toaten the tool<br>
			Laid back or stay strapped for pay back<br>
			To think that I'm slippin then crippin from way back<br>
			Now let me break it down a notch<br>
			Smooth like I do when I pound the cock<br>
			We cold motherfuckas holdin down the block<br>
			Everybody knowin that tha dogg pound is hot<br>
			We so cool now<br>
			<br>

			If everybody turn there radios on at twelve o'clock<br>
			We'll make the world pop<br>
			<br>

			It's too good right now<br>
			Blunkey blunkey<br>
			Remmey remmey<br>
			Plenty gumbo<br>
			Snoop gimme some mo'<br>
			Swakin that like a damn fool<br>
			Acedemics stacey adams feelin way to cool<br>
			Theres alot things that make me wanna frown though<br>
			But I'm grinnin like a motherfucka<br>
			Throwin dogg pound up<br>
			Snappin my fingaz stompin my feet<br>
			It's what you get from a gangsta with these hard ass beats<br>
			I'm cool as fuck and don't say to much<br>
			Talk shit to the homies cuz they know whats up<br>
			As the gangstas go dead diggle my niggle<br>
			Still got patience still makin niggaz<br>
			I just wanna be myself<br>
			What I receive from the homies is help<br>
			We had a conversation today about who aint pitchin in<br>
			Keep suckas away that don't fit in<br>
			I'm so cool<br>			</p>
